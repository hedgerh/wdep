# wdep

##Usage:
Pass a package.json file to wdep, and it will print a table containing all dependencies contained within the package, as well as descriptions for each module.  If you call wdep with no arguments, it will look for a package.json in the current directory.

```
wdep
or
wdep package.json
```


##Installation:
```
npm install -g wdep
```
